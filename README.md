WifiACE can work very well similar to WiFi PineappleÂ®. Work's perfectly with Kali and Parrotsec on rpi. Just run the setup script and select *yes* when it asks to add WifiACE to *crontab* and enable *USB tethering*.
##### Note : Note : If you are using any OS other than Parrotsec or Kali, following the steps given in the [Manual installation](#manually) and the following steps for startup support and USB tethering.

@reboot /path/to/wifiace/directory/wifiace.py &
```
#### USB tethering
Allows you to share internet of your smartphone with rpi. Add following lines to **/etc/network/interfaces**
```sh
#USB tethering config for wifiace
allow-hotplug usb0
iface usb0 inet static
address 192.168.42.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
```

WiFiAce requires ```root``` privilages for running. By default WIfiACE is accessible from http://127.0.0.1:5000 from your browser,if you have enabled USB tethering option then it is also accessible from http://192.168.42.1:5000 on your mobile device or else if you wish can change IP and Port while launching. The default ID and password is ```root:toor```.

Following are the launch options for *wifiace*. 
```
# python wifiace.py -h

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a HOST, --host HOST  IP address on which the server should bind leave it
                        blank to bind to localhost
  -p PORT, --port PORT  port for the webserver to run on (Default : 5000)
  -D, --debug           Starts wifiace in debug mode.(Warning:Instace checking
